Description: A rewrite of unclutter using the x11-xfixes extension
 This package varies from the Ubuntu version as it does not depend 
 on a daemon to cause the program to automatically start.  Rather, 
 the i3 config is responsible for starting unclutter in Regolith.  
 See https://github.com/regolith-linux/speed-ricer/issues/14 for 
 details.
